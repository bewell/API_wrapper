# API_wrapper

## Basic info
This wrapper is supposed to act as a gateway to the service. Given we don't want to grant all the methods to the users, we can expose only the methods we want. Using the self-generated tokens in the XML, we can grant as many users we want.

### Usage
Service is started easily, just by running:

./webpy_sample_webservice.py

By default the it will bind to the 8080 port
